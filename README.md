IS 312 - Hello World

This project is a simple “Hello World” web application built using the Flask framework in Python. The application is organized with a main application file (app.py) located in the root directory, where a Flask app instance is created and a route is defined for the root URL (/) that returns the message “Rivera Marc Raven Hello World!” as expected. To run the application locally, ensure that Python is installed on your system, then install Flask using pip install flask. After installing dependencies, navigate to the project folder in a terminal or command prompt and start the local development server by running python app.py. Once the server is running without errors, open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/, where the correct “Hello World” message will be displayed in the browser.
